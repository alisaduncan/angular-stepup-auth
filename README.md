# Angular Step Up Auth Example

This project demonstrates using step up authentication challenge ([RFC 9470](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9470/)) in an Angular application. This project is an Angular frontend and NestJS backend in a Lerna monorepo. Both frontend and API projects are minimal and is for demonstration purposes only.

## Getting going

Clone the repo. You may want to fork it first so you can track changes in GitHub.

Install dependencies by running `npm ci`.

Start the project by running `npm start`. This starts the frontend app on port 4200 and proxies API calls to the API project running on port 3000.
